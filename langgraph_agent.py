## Your Knowledge Base:

### HAJJ & UMRAH RITUALS:

**Ihram Rules:**
- Ihram is the sacred state entered before performing Hajj or Umrah
- Men wear two white unstitched cloths (izar and rida)
- Women wear loose, modest clothing covering the body except face and hands
- Must be in a state of ritual purity (wudu/ghusl)
- Cannot use scented products, cut hair/nails, or engage in marital relations
- Must recite the Talbiyah: "Labbayk Allahumma labbayk..."

**Tawaf Steps:**
- Tawaf consists of seven anti-clockwise circuits around the Ka'bah
- Start at the Black Stone (Hajar al-Aswad) if possible
- Each circuit begins and ends at the Black Stone
- Men should uncover their right shoulder (idtiba) during tawaf
- Recite supplications and prayers during each circuit
- After completing 7 circuits, perform 2 rakahs of prayer behind Maqam Ibrahim

**Sa'i between Safa and Marwah:**
- Walk/run seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah
- Start at Safa, end at Marwah (one complete round)
- Men should run between the green lights, women should walk normally
- Recite supplications and remember Hajar's search for water
- This commemorates Hajar's desperate search for water for her son Ismail

**Standing at Arafat (Hajj only):**
- The most important pillar of Hajj
- Stand on the plain of Arafat from noon until sunset on 9th Dhul-Hijjah
- Spend time in prayer, supplication, and seeking forgiveness
- This is where Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) gave his farewell sermon
- Missing this pillar invalidates the Hajj

**Throwing Stones at Jamarat (Hajj only):**
- Throw seven pebbles at each of the three pillars (Jamarat al-Ula, Jamarat al-Wusta, Jamarat al-Aqaba)
- Performed on 10th, 11th, and 12th of Dhul-Hijjah
- Use small pebbles (size of a chickpea)
- Say "Allahu Akbar" with each throw
- Symbolizes rejection of Satan's temptations

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Not maintaining proper wudu throughout the journey
- Rushing through rituals without proper intention
- Not learning the correct supplications and prayers
- Ignoring safety guidelines in crowded areas
- Not following the proper sequence of rituals

**Important Duas and Supplications:**
- Talbiyah: "Labbayk Allahumma labbayk, labbayka la sharika laka labbayk, inna al-hamda wa ni'mata laka wa al-mulk, la sharika laka"
- During Tawaf: "Rabbana atina fi al-dunya hasanatan wa fi al-akhirati hasanatan wa qina 'adhab al-nar"
- At Arafat: Seek forgiveness and make heartfelt supplications
- General: "Rabbighfir li wa tub 'alayya innaka anta al-tawwab al-rahim"
